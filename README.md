This is my new website.

The intention is to build out pages for:
- home
- [a] blog
- [my] portfolio
- contact [info]

Right now, it looks horrifically awful. That will soon change. Currently working on implementing Bootstrap into the design of the site. I've only just completed the first section of [Scrimba's React tutorial](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e) on static pages. 

Most of my work has been in more of a web *design* capacity. My intention is for this website to prove what I'm capable of and to jumpstart my immersion in web *development*. I've long wanted to learn React and TypeScript and I'm tired of feeling stagnant in building out WordPress pages, so... This has been a long time coming.
